            <p>You are alone at your home. A postman comes and puts a package in your postbox, rings your doorbell, and leaves. You take the package, bring it into your room, and notice there’s no name or any type of information on it—just the delivery date. You open the package and find a book titled <em>"The Unknown Book."</em></p>
            <p>When you open it, the first page contains a few lines about the author. The second page is the table of contents. Then, as you turn to Chapter 1, you see a picture related to the chapter. Suddenly, the book rises into the air, and a burst of light emerges from the picture. Before you know it, you are pulled into the picture.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 1:</strong></p>
            <p>Now, you find yourself in a mysterious world...</p>
